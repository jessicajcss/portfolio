abstract: The influence of specific local land-use activities (continuously redistributing elements across environments)
  and environmental conditions (altering the chemical composition of airborne particulate matter) on the 
  intrinsic health risk of PM2.5 exposure is sparsely reported. To fill this gap, we employed a novel 
  integrated approach to address the influence of short-term changes in source-specific PM2.5 composition 
  on the exposure-response risk, while controlling for weather conditions. We combine receptor-based source apportionment 
  with conditional logistic regression in a space-time-stratified case-crossover design. 
  The results emphasize the importance of source-specific air quality management 
  in complex areas and our research provides an adaptable universal tool to support targeted place-based policy interventions 
  to mitigate air pollution impacts on health.
