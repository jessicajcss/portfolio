abstract: For regulatory purposes, air pollution has been reduced to management of air quality control regions (AQCR), 
  by inventorying pollution sources and identifying the receptors significantly affected. However, beyond being source-dependent, 
  particulate matter can be physically and chemically altered by factors and elements of climate during transport, 
  as they act as local environmental constraints, indirectly modulating the adverse effects of particles 
  on the environment and human health. This case study, at an industrial site in a Brazilian coastal city – Joinville, 
  combines different methodologies to integrate atmospheric dynamics in a strategic risk assessment approach whereby 
  the influence of different wind regimes on environmental and health risks of exposure to PM2.5-bound elements, are analysed.
  Although Joinville AQCR has been prone to stagnation/recirculation events, distinctly different horizontal wind circulation patterns 
  indicate two airsheds within the region. The two sampling sites mirrored these two conditions and as a result we report 
  different PM2.5 mass concentrations, chemical profiles, geo-accumulation, and ecological and human health risks. In addition, 
  feedback mechanisms between the airsheds seem to aggravate the air quality and its effects even under good ventilation conditions. 
  Recognizably, the risks associated with Co, Pb, Cu, Ni, Mn, and Zn loadings were extremely high for the environment as well as
  being the main contributors to elevated non-carcinogenic risks. Meanwhile, higher carcinogenic risks occurred during 
  stagnation/recirculation conditions, with Cr as the major threat. These results highlight the importance of integrating 
  local airshed characteristics into the risk assessment of PM2.5-bound elements since they can aggravate air pollution leading 
  to different risks at a granular scale. This new approach to risk assessment can be employed in any city's longer-term development plan 
  since it provides public authorities with a strategic perspective on incorporating environmental constraints into urban growth planning 
  and development zoning regulations.
